      "description": "The Weaver - Added an Entropy slider that modulates the attraction rules over time to transition between rigid patterns and fluid chaos."
    },
    {
      "num": 2,
      "description": "The Weaver - Added a Crystallization toggle that locks particles onto an invisible geometric grid as Entropy decreases, forcing Chaos into Order."
    },
    {
      "num": 3,
      "description": "The Weaver - Added Harmonic Resonators that create ripples of geometric alignment, pulsating between strict symmetry and chaotic scattering."
    },
    {
      "num": 4,
      "description": "The Weaver - Added Entropy Entanglement where particles of the same type create ephemeral webs, bridging Order and Chaos through shared geometry."
    },
    {
      "num": 5,
      "description": "The Weaver - Added Temporal Symmetry, creating mirror-image ghosts of particles that reflect the balance between ordered reflection and chaotic divergence."
    },
    {
      "num": 6,
      "description": "The Weaver - Added Gravitational Wells, localized attractors that pulse between pulling matter into dense singularities and repulsing it into chaotic voids."
    },
    {
      "num": 7,
      "description": "The Weaver - Added Fractal Folding, a recursive spatial warping that bends the path of particles into nested self-similar loops as Order increases."
    },
    {
      "num": 8,
      "description": "The Weaver - Added Chromatographic Bleed, which allows colors to spill and mix across the canvas in chaos, but pinpoints them to sharp spectral emissions in order."
    },
    {
      "num": 9,
      "description": "The Weaver - Added Entropic Decay trails, where particles leave behind ghostly remnants of their past order that slowly dissolve into the chaotic background."
    },
    {
      "num": 10,
      "description": "The Weaver - Added Geometric Lattice, a dynamic tessellation that emerges when Order is high, connecting particles into a crystalline mesh based on localized density."
