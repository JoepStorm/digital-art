      "description": "The Monochromist - Replaced blue trails with a ghostly white fade and increased agent density for a delicate charcoal-on-paper aesthetic."
    },
    {
      "num": 2,
      "description": "The Cartographer - Introduced a subtle canvas texture and limited agent movement to create delicate, map-like contour lines."
    },
    {
      "num": 3,
      "description": "The Minimalist - Introduced void-repulsion and increased transparency to create delicate, floating geometric clouds with vast negative space."
    },
    {
      "num": 4,
      "description": "The Linearist - Constrained sensors to strictly forward-looking long vectors, forcing agents into extremely long, parallel hair-like strokes."
    },
    {
      "num": 5,
      "description": "The Etherealist - Reduced agent count and introduced a decaying sensory threshold to allow lines to dissipate into nothingness, emphasizing negative space and fragility."
    },
    {
      "num": 6,
      "description": "The Reductionist - Removed the sensory-seeking logic entirely, letting agents travel in pure linear trajectories that occasionally break into delicate, slow-motion curves for a more breath-like, sparse composition."
    },
    {
      "num": 7,
      "description": "The Threadweaver - Unified agent direction so lines flow in a singular, sweeping breath across the canvas."
    },
    {
      "num": 8,
      "description": "The Etcher - Restricted agents to vertical bands of activity, creating rhythmic sequences of white space and silent, silver-point density."
    }
