      "description": "The Weaver - Introduced calcified web persistence by modifying the background fade to preserve cellular walls."
    },
    {
      "num": 2,
      "description": "The Osteoblast - Introduced a hardening logic where existing web structures slow agents down and force 'calcification' through higher density deposits."
    },
    {
      "num": 3,
      "description": "The Arachnid - Introduced communal silk-binding behavior via dynamic sensor scaling, causing microorganisms to weave bridging fibers between dense calcified nodes."
    },
    {
      "num": 4,
      "description": "The Mycelium - Introduced lateral \"branching\" behavior where agents grow secondary filamentous shoots when hitting dense structural barriers."
    },
    {
      "num": 5,
      "description": "The Crystallographer - Introduced crystalline nucleation points that attract agents, causing the web to form radial structural clusters like mineralizing cellular colonies."
    },
    {
      "num": 6,
      "description": "The Bio-Electrician - Introduced conductive ion trails where agents release oscillating electrical pulses that jump across gaps, creating a high-energy \"synaptic\" network within the calcified structure."
    },
    {
      "num": 7,
      "description": "The Symbiote - Introduced intercellular adhesion where agents periodically snap to neighbors, forming tight-knit clusters that act as secondary colonial hubs."
    },
    {
      "num": 8,
      "description": "The Calcifier - Introduced mineralization cross-linking where agents deposit structural cross-beams if they detect two dense colonies nearby, reinforcing the architectural bridge."
    },
    {
      "num": 9,
      "description": "The Ossifier - Introduced structural tension where agents secrete tension-filaments (lines) that bridge nearby high-density nodes, reinforcing the micro-scaffold."
    },
    {
      "num": 10,
      "description": "The Metallurgist - Introduced structural plating where agents deposit dense horizontal and vertical 'lamellae' when they cross the principal axes of the colonial hubs."
    },
    {
      "num": 11,
      "description": "The Chitinizer - Introduced structural cross-linking where agents deposit secondary reinforcement webs between their current and previous positions, building translucent chitinous planes."
    },
    {
      "num": 12,
      "description": "The Cytoskeletist - Introduced contractile stress fibers that snap into existence between dense cellular hubs, pulling agents into geometric alignment and weaving thick structural cords."
    },
    {
      "num": 13,
      "description": "The Vacuolist - Introduced cytoplasmic expansion where agents inflate translucent organic membranes (ellipses) in low-density voids, filling the gaps between calcified scaffolds."
    },
    {
      "num": 14,
      "description": "The Lignifier - Introduced lignified lignin-deposit clusters where agents slow significantly in dense areas to reinforce structural nodes with amber-tinted cross-links."
    },
    {
      "num": 15,
      "description": "The Silicatist - Introduced biogenic silica polymerization where agents trailing through high-density \"lignified\" zones deposit crystalline glass-like structures (thin sharp strokes) that harden the web's connectivity."
    },
    {
      "num": 16,
      "description": "The Hyphae-Gardener - Introduced metabolic fruiting bodies that blossom at structural junctions, depositing vibrant bioluminescent clusters to mark ancient web hubs."
    },
    {
      "num": 17,
      "description": "The Chitin-Architect - Introduced chitinous plates that solidify between close-proximity agents in high-density zones, creating irregular polygonal structural membranes."
    },
    {
      "num": 18,
      "description": "The Neuro-Architect - Introduced synaptic dendrites where agents in high-density areas forge long-range, glowing neural connections to help structure the colony's overarching geometry."
    },
    {
      "num": 19,
      "description": "The Myofibril-Architect - Introduced contractile protein bundles (tensegrity cables) that pull toward the center, creating thick, striated structural ropes."
    },
    {
      "num": 20,
      "description": "The Vesicle-Transporter - Introduced fluid-filled osmotic vesicles (gradient-filled circles) that drift from dense hubs to hydrate the web, leaving shimmering residue."
