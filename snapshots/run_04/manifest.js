    {
      "num": 1,
      "description": "The Weaver of Shadows - Introduced an evaporation decay factor to the trail map for a ghostly sense of impermanence."
    },
    {
      "num": 2,
      "description": "The Ethereal Wanderer - Introduced brownian motion and directional noise to mimic the entropy of decaying memory."
    },
    {
      "num": 3,
      "description": "The Harbinger of Bloom - Introduced a life-cycle to agents where they die and respawn, preventing static patterns from dominating the void."
    },
    {
      "num": 4,
      "description": "The Transient Pulse - Introduced an oscillating sensory radius to mimic the rhythmic breathing of a living organism."
    },
    {
      "num": 5,
      "description": "The Spectral Weaver - Introduced variable deposition strength based on agent age, creating a \"fading ink\" effect as they approach the end of their lives."
    },
    {
      "num": 6,
      "description": "The Echo of Mortality - Introduced a selective decay where the void pushes back harder against older, weaker structures."
    },
    {
      "num": 7,
      "description": "The Gossamer Veil - Introduced velocity modulation where agents slow down as they age, causing \"terminal thickening\" of dying structures."
    },
    {
      "num": 8,
      "description": "The Dissolving Nexus - Introduced spatial gravity towards the mouse to simulate the longing of fleeting structures for connection."
    },
    {
      "num": 9,
      "description": "The Ossified Whisper - Introduced a subtle \"fossilization\" where extremely dense trails become harder to erase, creating a skeletal persistence."
    },
    {
      "num": 10,
      "description": "The Liminal Threshold - Introduced a boundary-repulsion effect where agents lose the ability to deposit ink if they drift too close to the edge, creating a faded \"vignette\" of mortal transition."
    },
    {
      "num": 11,
      "description": "The Tenebrous Echo - Introduced a parasitic feedback where agents are subtly repelled by their own dense histories, forcing them to constantly seek new territory."
    },
    {
      "num": 12,
      "description": "The Chrysalis Tide - Introduced a global metabolism that oscillates, causing the entire network to periodically soften and dilate."
    },
    {
      "num": 13,
      "description": "The Glacial Drift - Introduced a directional bias based on local ink density, causing trails to slowly \"weep\" or slide in the direction of gravity."
    },
    {
      "num": 14,
      "description": "The Entropic Sigh - Introduced a subtle pixel fragmentation where trail intensity occasionally \"leaks\" to neighbors, blurring old paths into a misty haze."
    },
    {
      "num": 15,
      "description": "The Chromatic Fray - Introduced a subtle wavelength-dependent scattering where blue light escapes faster, leaving warm chromatic ghosting in decaying trails."
    },
    {
      "num": 16,
      "description": "The Pulmonary Mirage - Introduced a non-linear breathing of the sensor distance that pulses with the heartbeat of the canvas."
    },
    {
      "num": 17,
      "description": "The Weaver of Shadows - Introduced \"Fractured Memories,\" a spatial displacement where agents occasionally jump to their mirrored coordinate, creating a haunted symmetry of impermanence."
    },
    {
      "num": 18,
      "description": "The Subterranean Pulse - Introduced a geological fracturing where high-intensity trails experience \"thermal cracking,\" splitting their darkness into fine, web-like fissures."
    },
    {
      "num": 19,
      "description": "The Osmotic Bleed - Introduced a depth-aware diffusion where heavy ink deposits \"stain\" deeper into the canvas, causing them to spread sideways based on their own darkness."
    },
    {
      "num": 20,
      "description": "The Vitreous Humour - Introduced a refractive distortion where fluid-like \"pockets\" of transparency bend the paths of overlapping trails."
    }
